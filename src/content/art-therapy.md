## What is art therapy?

Art Therapy is a unique form of psychotherapy that uses the art process to assist clients in expressing thoughts, feelings, and memories. It can function as an auxiliary process, sometimes called “Art as Therapy,” wherein people find relief and healing from the art process itself, and also engage in verbal discussion aided by the soothing properties of art-making; or it can also function as a primary process, with thoughts and feelings being expressed directly through the art that is made, and may not be remarked upon verbally at that time.

The creative process uses areas of the brain that are typically associated with sensory memory, experience of emotion and imaginative play, making Art Therapy ideal for some populations that may not be as responsive to verbally oriented therapies such as: children, persons with developmental problems or disabilities, trauma survivors, introverted persons or those who experience high levels of anxiety, traumatic brain injuries, and individuals with substance use problems.

It is also helpful for families, or individuals who have difficulty accessing unconscious material and wish to develop greater capacity for insight.

Drawing upon her background in sculpture, Mikella also works with patients to use three dimensional art-making to symbolize conflicts or intentions, in order to transform the object or imbue it with meaning. This can be as concrete as writing a letter or depicting a memory, and then transforming or destroying the object; or as abstract as creating talismans or ritual objects during session.
