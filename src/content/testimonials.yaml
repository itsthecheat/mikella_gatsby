hypnosis:
  - I have been dealing with an intense fear of flying for several years.  I tried many different forms of therapy around this including hypnotherapy with a practitioner who made me very uncomfortable.  Nothing worked at all.

  - I worked with Mikella Millen last year specifically around my fear of flying.  Mikella made me feel so comfortable right from the beginning.  There is a real calm confidence about her that instantly put me at ease.  We talked at length before beginning hypnosis so I knew what to expect.  We did 5 sessions of hypnotherapy leading up to a trip I was taking.  I was not sure if it had even worked until I got on the plane.  I was so much calmer than I had been previously.  I’ve found that even though a lot of time has passed, the results have continued to develop for me.  I’m preparing to fly again with almost none of the usual anxiety I’ve felt in the past.  Working with Mikella was a really wonderful experience and would recommend her to anyone looking to overcome a fear or just wanting to get to know themselves a bit better.

  reiki:
    - Mikella was really great to work with, especially it being my first experience with reiki. She was patient and warm, explained everything that she would be doing first, then reviewed with me afterwards what she picked up, and shared her ideas about it very openly, answering all my questions. Great experience!
    - My Reiki session with Mikella Millen was truly transformative. Mikella organically creates an inclusive and safe space that compliments her warm and gentle approach to the Reiki experience. I literally drifted away as my energy fields released the angst and toxins of NYC’s ever-pulsing environment. Mikella is a true healer; the impact of her healing presence is palpable. I highly recommend Reiki sessions to all including fellow therapists and healers!
